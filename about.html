            <p class="indent">Hello! I&#39;m Kseniia and I&#39;m an Ukrainian beginner Ruby on Rails full&#8208;stack developer living and studying in the Tallinn, Estonia. </p>
            <p class="indent">I have started to be interested in a frontend like a hobby from 4 years ago. But about 1,5 years ago I understood, that I want to make a development not for just a funny and like a job which will is one of my vital stuff in my life.</p>
            <p class="indent">A development is became my passion, itself Ruby on Rails &ndash; now my obsession, I love coding and I know what I want achieve. And for my goals I know that wanting to work with a team, after all cool projects created by team. And it&#39;s
                just more fun to work together<span>&#128522; So now I am looking for my dream job.</p>
            
            <p class="my-path">Ok, what about my path…</p>

            <p class="indent">I tried many different directions from saleswoman and fitness instructor to assistant of director in my life. And it helps a lot in life to understand what you really want. </p>
            <p class="indent">When I interested frontend I started to learning from HTML, CSS and JS languages from many different sources of internet. But it gave me just surface information. Then I was very happy to finding Coursera and I become immersion deeply to &ldquo;HTML, CSS and JS Web development&rdquo; Johns Hopkins University course. Also I gave interesting course Ruby on Rails Web Development of Udemy.</p>
            <p class="indent">And it was really only my start. Then I run into whole specialization &ldquo;Ruby on Rails full&#8208;stack development&rdquo; and passed course by course of Johns Hopkins University. Frontend wasn&#39;t so difficult for me, but full&#8208;stack was more complicated. So it&#39;s and likes me in development, give assignment &ndash; get solution. </p>
            <p class="indent">And now I think I have basic skills to become developer. Even I must for start working like a frontend but I understand that also excellent start for my carrier like Ruby on Rails full&#8208;stack developer. </p>
